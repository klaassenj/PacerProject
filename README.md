Pi powered Traxxas Slash follows the lines on the track to pace athletes to Personal Bests.

The attached Pi Camera feeds a stream of images to a Image Classification Convolutional Neural Net.
The Neural Net then decides how to adjust the 2WD Servo to best stay on the lane line.

### Components:
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+
- ~~Array of IR sensors~~  
- Servo Driver board
- Traxxas Slash 2WD
- Long Life RC Car Battery
- 10000 mAh Portable Battery
- Pi Camera
- Bluetooth Speaker


## Laser Pacer (Likely Unsafe)
  A Raspberry Pi Project to create an Indoor Track Pacing System using Math, Lasers, and Servos.
